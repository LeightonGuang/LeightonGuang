          I am passionate about Software Engineering because I consider myself a
          maker/creator at heart. I love creating things and giving people a
          pleasant experience using it. I got into Software Engineering because
          I found out that being a software engineer also allows me to be
          creative simply through a computer, without relying on physical tools
          or materials. As a quick problem solver, I hope I can apply my skills
          to drive companies to new heights.
